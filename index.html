                    Full Stack Developer looking for a career in a space that 
                    is making a positive impact.  I have life experience, police officer training, customer service experience in the service industry, college education, and most recently 
                    a certificate from the UCF Coding Boot Camp.  During my time in the Bootcamp, I was working full time during a pandemic, raising a two year old, all the while proving my 
                    dedication to furthering myself by putting in the time to learn the 15+ technologies (MERN stack, Javascript, HTML/CSS, frameworks, algorithms, etc) the Bootcamp went over 
                    while having no prior experience in coding.  I applied everything I learned in the bootcamp to finish a recent project where I worked on my own to develop a MERN app called 
                    iGrow that helps people explore their true selves in order to develop as a person, which was graded as an A for that particular project.  I also had the opportunity to work 
                    in a group setting for a previous project, leading the creative and design process for the Chicken Tender food matching app resulting in a grade of A+. I am proud to have a 
                    proven history of success in learning various different fields of technology from the ground up. I believe my ability to problem solve, learn rapidly, and work well with 
                    others will contribute greatly to my overall success as a developer.   I hope to work in my career to make important changes in the world helping people through the 
                    professional technologies I have learned combined with my strengths in character, honesty, intuition, and creativity.    Check my work out in the Portfolio page!
