                    I am a 32 year old father, husband, gamer, writer, musician, and soon to be programmer.  I enjoy learning new things, playing video games, playing and running 
                    Dungeons and Dragons, watching historical fictions, and playing with my 22 month old son Finn.  I am currently going through the UCF coding boot camp for web
                    development, and hope to move into programming and possibly game development in the future.  So far I have worked on some games from the various homework activities, 
                    as well as one major group project for the amazing app Chicken Tender.  Check my work out in the Portfolio page!
